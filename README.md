## 🔭 Overview

This project provides a comprehensive solution for telecommunications customer churn analysis and prediction. It demonstrates an end-to-end data science workflow from data loading and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, deployment, and visualization through an interactive dashboard.

The solution helps businesses answer critical questions like:
- Which customers are likely to churn?
- What are the primary drivers of customer churn?
- How can we develop targeted retention strategies based on customer segments?

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Interactive Dashboard**: Comprehensive Streamlit-based visualization dashboard with filtering capabilities
- **Real-time Predictions**: FastAPI backend for quick churn predictions via REST API
- **Machine Learning Pipeline**: End-to-end ML pipeline with feature engineering, preprocessing, and hyperparameter tuning
- **Data Persistence**: PostgreSQL database integration for storing customer data
- **Containerization**: Docker and Docker Compose for easy deployment and scaling
- **Dynamic Visualizations**: Multiple interactive plots and charts using Plotly
- **Statistical Insights**: Advanced statistical analysis of churn factors
- **ML Model Optimization**: Threshold optimization for classification metrics
- **Model Reporting**: Comprehensive reports including ROC curves, confusion matrices, and classification metrics

## 🏗️ Architecture

The project follows a modern microservices architecture with three main components:

1. **Backend Service (FastAPI)**: 
   - Serves ML model predictions via RESTful API
   - Handles model training and evaluation
   - Generates model performance reports

2. **Frontend Application (Streamlit)**:
   - Provides an interactive dashboard for data exploration
   - Visualizes churn patterns and insights
   - Offers a user interface for making predictions

3. **Database (PostgreSQL)**:
   - Stores customer data and metadata
   - Enables SQL-based data querying

All services are containerized using Docker and orchestrated with Docker Compose for seamless deployment.

## 💻 Technology Stack

- **Backend**: 
  - FastAPI for API development
  - scikit-learn for machine learning
  - SQLAlchemy for ORM

- **Frontend**:
  - Streamlit for the interactive dashboard
  - Plotly for advanced data visualizations

- **Database**:
  - PostgreSQL for data storage

- **DevOps**:
  - Docker for containerization
  - Docker Compose for multi-container orchestration

- **Data Analysis & ML**:
  - pandas for data manipulation
  - scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms
  - matplotlib/Plotly for visualization

## 🧠 Machine Learning Details

### Model Selection
The project uses a **Gradient Boosting Classifier** with hyperparameter tuning via RandomizedSearchCV and cross-validation.

### Feature Engineering
- Created derived features such as `avg_charge_per_month`
- Service usage count metrics
- Tenure categorization into meaningful buckets

### Preprocessing Pipeline
- Separate numerical and categorical preprocessing pipelines
- Missing value imputation
- Feature scaling
- One-hot encoding for categorical variables

### Hyperparameter Tuning
- RandomizedSearchCV for efficient hyperparameter space exploration
- 5-fold cross-validation to prevent overfitting
- ROC AUC as the optimization metric

### Threshold Optimization
- Custom threshold selection to balance precision and recall
- F1 score optimization for classification threshold

### Evaluation Metrics
- ROC AUC score
- F1 score
- Classification report
- Confusion matrix



## 🚀 Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git

### Quick Start

1. Start the application:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. Access the components:
   - Streamlit Dashboard: http://localhost:8501
   - FastAPI Documentation: http://localhost:8000/docs

### Manual Setup (Without Docker)

1. Setup PostgreSQL database:
   ```bash

   psql -U postgres -d churn_db -f postgres/create_schema.sql
   ```

2. Install backend dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   pip install -r api/requirements.txt
   python api/train_model.py
   uvicorn api.main:app --reload
   ```

3. Install frontend dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
